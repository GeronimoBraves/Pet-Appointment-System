# Pet Appointment Management System

When looking for veterinary treatment, pet owners can view a digital practice on a veterinary website. In order to avoid creating a negative first impression, we created veterinary website designs that present the office in a slick, expert manner that shows our skills, informs clients, provides answers to queries, and does much more. Our project is a visual representation of a systematic system designed for various vet appointments for the pets by interaction through a user-friendly website. 
We tried to include as many features as we could as it is important for the clinic to store information about the patient whether they are a recurring patient or a new client. Details of the owner of the pet for contact processes and that of the pets is necessary for medical processes. Our website tries to check for various appointments scheduling for the pets in an efficient manner for various breeds and according to the required slots.

Our project is a visual representation of a systematic system designed for various hospital appointments for the patients by interaction through a user-friendly website. Following are the pages that our website contains:
1. Home page: It is the introductory page of our website which asks for the appointment booking from the customers. It includes services, appointments for the required doctors along with their specialities and resources as a navbar link where we can land on the respective page itself. It also contains basic information for welcoming about the hospital and also we can review the options for various appointments of the patients. Further the page contains contact form where we can ask questions , call or email us so that we can provide further information, online forms for our patient which can be completed before you book an appointment, schedule the appointment, look for different departments and meet the doctors, and also the wellness and checkup care option to learn more about it. Last page contains the contact us form where we can give a basic information about your patient's health and at last the clinic hours presented so that no one can miss the appointments and schedule it on a given timing. 
2. Appointment page: The starting page contains the booking of appointments for various doctors with all their data. After selecting the doctor, the next page will ask about the date, timings. It also provides basic data about consultation fees. After selecting the necessary date and slot, the next page asks about the basic client information like the name, email after confirming the doctor details and then a request is submitted.
3. Services page: This page contains the services which are provided by them to us. The first page contains the need for checkup. It includes various options in the dropdown list as cardiology, neurology, dentistry, cancer care etc services are available. Also contains blogs on the pages where we can get more information about their services with their benefits as well. Next it contains the appointment request page where we can book an appointment urgently or in an online format by giving the basic details of us with the date and time to be selected by our needs which will submit  the message and a database will be noted which can inform us of the appointment. Further it includes the location page where you can choose the nearby location of the hospitals for the betterment, and can also include the phone number which we can directly call and book the appointment. 
4. Blog page:  This page is designed to display all the articles, blogs, and notices that the hospital needs to display. This range of posts are divided into several categories, some of which can be further categorized into subcategories. This is displayed as a small navbar on the right side of the page. Selecting any of the categories will load a different list of articles under that specific category. The user can click on any of the articles to read the entire content related to the topic. This page was created to increase interaction of people with the community, as well as find other necessary information related to all the daily activities. We also added a category for helping the users in one of the biggest struggles, that is choosing a doctor. With the importance of hospitals becoming more and more relevant in modern society, this page will help the users keep in contact with fellow doctors.
